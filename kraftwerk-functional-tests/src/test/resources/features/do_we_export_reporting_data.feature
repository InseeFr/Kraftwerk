Feature: Do we save correctly all reporting data ?
  Everybody wants to know if we save them correctly

  Scenario Outline: Do we create reporting data file with the right structure
    Given Step 0 : We have some survey in directory "<Directory>"
    And We have reporting data file in "<ReportingDataFile>"
    When We launch reporting data service
    Then We should have a file named "<OutputFileName>" in directory "<Directory>" with <ExpectedReportingDataFieldCount> reporting data fields

    Examples:
    # Parameters :
    # - Directory : Directory of test campaigns
    # - OutputFileName : Name of reporting data file (with .csv extension)
    # - ExpectedReportingDataFieldCount : Expected field quantity excluding interrogationId
